# CaeserCipher

Working Ceaser Cipher

This is a Ceaser Cipher class that is used to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Ceaser Cipher algorithm. This code is written in Java so make sure you are using a
.java file and that it is running on a Java IDE. When you run this program a message will pop up that will ask the user if they would like a message encrypted or decrypted. Make sure to spell 'Encrypt' or 'Decrypt' correctly; however, case sensitivity is not a requirement. If you select 'encrypt' or 'decrypt' it will prompt the user to enter their plain message or encrypted message. Once the user has inputted their message they will be asked to add a key, this key will be used to either encrypt the message or decrypt the message, it has to be between 1 and 26 or thier will be an error. After that the user will get an output with thier new encrypted message or decrypted message. If the user chose to decrypt a message not only will they they get a decrypted version of thier message, but they will also get a list of all possible decryptions ranging from 1 to 26. These are the possible decryption messages that would have been outputted for thier encrypted message depending on the key inputted from 1 to 26. inputted for these possible Decrypted messages.

NOTE: The numbers on the left of possible Decrypted messages has nothing to do with their key

NOTE: DO NOT ADD ANY SPECIAL CHARACTERS
